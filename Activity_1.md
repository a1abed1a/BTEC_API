# Investigating APIs

API stands for **Application Programming Interface**.  
API allows an application to talk to another application to transfer stored data or instructions.  

APIs can be broken down into four main types:
- Open/Public APIs  
   They are completely public access APIs, with no restrictions on who can use them.
- Partner APIs  
   They are similar to open APIs, but restricted access features are often controlled through a third-party API.
- Private/Internal APIs  
   They cannot be seen by external users because they are supposed to be hidden. They are used to share resources within the organization. It enables different business teams or departments to use each other's tools, data, and software.
- Composite APIs  
   They are a combination of service and data application programming interfaces APIs used to increase performance and speed up the execution of specific activities.

## Benefits of APIs
- Different development teams may be working on all parts of the API at the same time.
- Low development costs, API-First technology allows for code reuse between projects, ensuring that development teams have an infrastructure to work with at all times.

- The risk of mistake is substantially minimized with API, because of reliability and stability in concept and implementation.

## Differences between API and SDK
SDK is an integrated platform that contains a set of tools for developing these applications.  
The API is intended to perform a single function to allow communication between programs.  
while the SDK is an integrated platform that includes a set of tools for creating these applications. APIs make it easy for applications to communicate with each other, but they are not enough to develop a completely new application.  

| API | SDK |
| - | - |
|  Connects and Combines | Comes with a number of development tools |
| Lightweight, quick, and typically specialized | More robust, with a wide range of tools. |
| To add specific functions | For creating new applications or adding many functionalities with one package |
